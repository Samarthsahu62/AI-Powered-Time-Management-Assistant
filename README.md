# AI-Powered Time Management Assistant

## ðŸ“Œ Project Title
**AI-Powered Time Management Assistant**

## ðŸ“– Project Description
This project introduces a decentralized AI-enhanced time management assistant, designed to help users create, manage, and track personal tasks effectively on-chain. Utilizing the Soroban smart contract platform, tasks are stored immutably with real-time status updates and timestamps for productivity tracking.

## ðŸ”­ Project Vision
The vision is to develop a secure, decentralized, and transparent time management assistant that leverages AI (off-chain oracles) to suggest optimal task schedules and manage time more efficientlyâ€”while storing task metadata on-chain for transparency and trust.

## âœ¨ Key Features
- **Create Task:** Users can create new tasks with a title and store them on-chain.
- **Complete Task:** Users can mark a task as completed, allowing tracking of productivity.
- **View Task:** Retrieve task details using the task ID.
- **Task Counter:** View the total number of tasks created for a given user.

## ðŸš€ Future Scope
- **AI Integration:** Off-chain AI modules can suggest task priorities or optimal schedules.
- **Reminders and Notifications:** Smart contracts could emit events that external apps subscribe to for alerts.
- **Collaborative Tasks:** Enable group tasks with multiple users and decentralized approvals.
- **Task Categories and Deadlines:** Add fields for categorization and deadline enforcement via contract logic.
- **Gamification Layer:** Incentivize users with badges or tokens for productivity streaks.
